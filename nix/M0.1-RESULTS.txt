=== M0.1: Hash Generation Results ===

Date: 2025-10-27
Agent: AI DevOps Agent
Milestone: M0.1 - Hash Generation
Status: ✅ COMPLETE

=== Generated Hashes ===

Source Hash (fetchFromGitHub):
  sha256-Au2UcHgJ9N1o1fnZZOb7IuZB/4HPlk/MLPZIWpkLgAQ=

NPM Dependencies Hash (buildNpmPackage):
  sha256-ElU9TiSlQE0B0jXrwanGeTZ89AAuxwzE9sjQlEL862M=

=== Verification ===

✅ Tag v1.1.0 verified (commit: 5b89e1873abcbc7eb48ff04384686a457d251cc9)
✅ Source hash generated via nix-prefetch-url
✅ NPM hash extracted from buildNpmPackage error output
✅ Both hashes updated in default.nix
✅ Hashes validated (npm-deps derivation completed successfully)

=== Build Status ===

⚠️  Full build fails due to missing build dependencies:
- kerberos package requires gssapi/gssapi.h
- This is EXPECTED for M0.1 - build issues addressed in M1

Hash generation phase COMPLETE - M1.1 is now UNBLOCKED.

=== Additional Fixes Applied ===

1. Fixed source hash format (removed duplicate "sha256-" prefix)
2. Fixed desktop file categories (removed non-standard "AI" category)
3. Added postPatch to copy package-lock.json for npm-deps derivation
4. Verified subdirectory structure (ainative-studio/)

=== Next Steps ===

1. Commit these changes to feature branch
2. Initialize ZeroDB memory with M0.1 results
3. Deploy AI Build Agent for M1.1 (Core Derivation)
4. M1.1 will fix build dependencies:
   - Add krb5 to buildInputs for gssapi headers
   - Fix any other compilation issues
   - Complete desktop integration

=== Commands Used ===

```bash
# Source hash generation
nix-prefetch-url --unpack "https://github.com/AINative-Studio/AINativeStudio-IDE/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.0.tar.gz"

# NPM hash extraction
nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./default.nix {}'
# (extracted from hash mismatch error)
```

=== Coding Rules Applied ===

✅ Rule 2.1: Chain-of-thought reasoning (see M0.1-CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT.md)
✅ Rule 2.2: Requirements clarification (analyzed tag format, subdirectory structure)
✅ Rule 2.3: Alternative approaches (nix-prefetch-github vs nix-prefetch-url)
✅ Rule 7: Self-validation (verified hashes, documented fixes)
