AINative Studio is the open-source Cursor alternative.

Use AI agents on your codebase, checkpoint and visualize changes, and bring any model or host locally. AINative Studio sends messages directly to providers without retaining your data.

This repo contains the full sourcecode for AINative Studio. If you're new, welcome!

## 🚀 Quick Development Setup

Use these convenient development scripts for easy setup and management:

```bash
# Full development setup (first time or when dependencies change)
./dev-start.sh      # Installs dependencies, builds, and runs with watch mode

# Quick start (when already built)
./dev-quick.sh      # Just starts the application (faster)

# Stop all development processes
./dev-stop.sh       # Stops watch processes and application
```

**What each script does:**
- `dev-start.sh`: Complete setup including dependency installation, React component building, TypeScript compilation with watch mode, and application launch
- `dev-quick.sh`: Quick application start (assumes project is already built)
- `dev-stop.sh`: Cleanly stops all development processes (watch builds and application)
