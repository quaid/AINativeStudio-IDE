  Error: SignPath signing request was not created. Please make sure that connector-url is pointing 
  to the SignPath GitHub Actions connector endpoint.

● I can see the Windows ARM64 build is failing due to incorrect SignPath API parameters. Looking
  at the error, the SignPath connector is expecting a different payload structure with a
  ciSystemSigningRequestDataDto field.

  Let me check the current workflow configuration and fix it:

● Read(~/AINativeStudio-IDE/.github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml)
  ⎿  Read 381 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me check the other Windows workflows to see if they have similar issues:

● Search(pattern: "signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request", path: "../.github/workflows",
        glob: "*.yml")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check the Windows x64 workflow to see if it has the same issue:

● Read(~/AINativeStudio-IDE/.github/workflows/Windowsx64.yml)
  ⎿  Read 25 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(~/AINativeStudio-IDE/.github/workflows/Windowsx64.yml)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The issue is that the SignPath GitHub Action is expecting additional parameters. Based on the
  error message, the API endpoint expects a different payload structure. Let me check the
  SignPath documentation to understand the correct parameters:

● Web Search("SignPath GitHub Action submit-signing-request parameters
            ciSystemSigningRequestDataDto")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 24s                                                                        

● Let me check the SignPath GitHub Action repository directly for the correct usage:

● Fetch(https://github.com/SignPath/github-action-submit-signing-request)
  ⎿  Received 232.8KB (200 OK)

● Let me check the official SignPath documentation:

● Fetch(https://docs.signpath.io/trusted-build-systems/github)
  ⎿  Received 34.8KB (200 OK)

● Now I understand the issue. The workflows are missing some required parameters. Let me fix both
   Windows workflows:

● Fixed the SignPath GitHub Action issues in both Windows workflows. The problem was that the
  action requires:

  1. Dynamic artifact ID: Instead of using a hardcoded string like 'ainative-studio-win32-arm64',
   it needs the actual artifact ID from a previous upload step
  2. Proper workflow: Download the artifact first, then re-upload it specifically for SignPath,
  and use the output artifact ID from that upload

  The changes ensure SignPath receives the correct artifact reference through the ${{ 
  steps.upload-for-signing.outputs.artifact-id }} variable.

> how confident are you this solves this problem?

● Moderately confident, but not certain. Here's why:

  What I fixed:
  - The main error was that github-artifact-id was hardcoded as a string instead of using the
  actual artifact ID from an upload step
  - SignPath requires the dynamic artifact ID from actions/upload-artifact@v4 output

  Remaining uncertainties:
  1. The original error mentioned ciSystemSigningRequestDataDto field being required, which isn't
   directly addressed by standard action parameters
  2. The connector URL defaults to https://githubactions.connectors.signpath.io but wasn't
  specified in your workflows - this might be needed
  3. The SignPath project configuration (ainative-studio-ide, test-signing, portable-executable)
  needs to exist in your SignPath account

  To increase confidence:
  - Verify the SignPath project/policy/artifact configuration exists
  - Consider adding connector-url: 'https://githubactions.connectors.signpath.io' explicitly
  - The API token needs proper permissions (submitter role)

  The fix addresses the most obvious issue (dynamic artifact ID), but SignPath's API error
  suggests there might be additional configuration needed on their platform side.

● Pushed successfully. The SignPath parameter fixes are now live on the main branch.

> did we change the builds?

● No, we only changed the SignPath code signing configuration. The builds themselves remain
  unchanged:

  What we modified:
  - Fixed the sign job in both Windows workflows (x64 and ARM64)
  - Added steps to properly pass artifact IDs to SignPath

  What we didn't touch:
  - Build process remains the same
  - Compilation steps unchanged
  - Package creation unchanged
  - Build artifacts unchanged

  The builds will produce the exact same output - we just fixed how they get signed by SignPath
  afterwards.

> what about the package?

● The package jobs were not modified. They remain exactly the same:

  Package job workflow:
  1. Downloads the signed artifact from SignPath
  2. Extracts the signed build
  3. Installs Inno Setup
  4. Creates User Setup and System Setup installers
  5. Uploads the installers as artifacts

  The package jobs already reference the signed artifacts correctly and should work once SignPath
   successfully signs the builds. No changes were needed there.

> it is so frustrating to run these. They take so long to debug

● Absolutely. Windows builds taking 25-40+ minutes each iteration is brutal for debugging. Here
  are some strategies that might help:

  Quick debugging approaches:

  1. Test SignPath locally first:
  # Use their API directly to validate credentials/config
  curl -X POST https://api.signpath.io/v1/...

  2. Create a minimal test workflow:
  # .github/workflows/test-signpath.yml
  name: Test SignPath Only
  on: workflow_dispatch
  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Create dummy file
          run: echo "test" > test.exe
        - name: Upload artifact
          uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
          id: upload
          with:
            name: test-artifact
            path: test.exe
        - name: Test SignPath
          uses: signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request@v1
          with:
            api-token: ${{ secrets.SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN }}
            organization-id: 'e7b381ae-94e5-4fee-b694-0828622d0e95'
            project-slug: 'ainative-studio-ide'
            signing-policy-slug: 'test-signing'
            artifact-configuration-slug: 'portable-executable'
            github-artifact-id: ${{ steps.upload.outputs.artifact-id }}

  3. Skip build, use existing artifacts: Download previous build artifacts and just test the
  signing/packaging steps
  4. Use workflow_dispatch with skip parameters: Add conditionals to skip expensive steps during
  debugging

  Would you like me to create a minimal test workflow to validate just the SignPath integration?

> what is the path it cuts off

● Looking at the error message, the SignPath connector is cutting off the response at:

  "errors":{"Body":["Submit signing request payload has unexpected JSON
  schema."],"ciSystemSigningRequestDataDto":["The ciSystemSigningRequestDataDto field is
  required."]}

  The issue is that SignPath's API expects a different payload structure. The
  ciSystemSigningRequestDataDto field suggests the connector expects CI system metadata that the
  GitHub Action isn't providing correctly.

  This might be a version mismatch - the SignPath action might need additional parameters or a
  different version. The error indicates the connector at
  https://githubactions.connectors.signpath.io expects a different request format than what the
  action is sending.

> This githubactions.connectors.signpath.io page can’t be found
  No webpage was found for the web address: https://githubactions.connectors.signpath.io/
  HTTP ERROR 404

● That's the problem! The SignPath connector URL doesn't exist. The workflow is trying to use a
  default URL that's not valid.

  Let me check what the correct URL should be:

● Web Search("SignPath connector URL GitHub Actions correct endpoint")
  ⎿  Did 2 searches in 21s                                                                      

● The issue is clear now - there's no connector-url parameter needed. The SignPath GitHub Action
  should connect directly to SignPath's API. The problem might be:

  1. The action version (@v1) might be outdated
  2. The SignPath project configuration might not exist
  3. The API token might not have proper permissions

  Let me check if we should use a different version:

● Fetch(https://github.com/marketplace/actions/submit-a-signing-request)
  ⎿  Error: Request failed with status code 404

● Fetch(https://github.com/SignPath/github-action-submit-signing-request/releases)
  ⎿  Received 171.1KB (200 OK)

● Let me check the actual action repository to see what versions are available:

● Bash(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/SignPath/github-action-submit-signing-request/tags | jq
      -r '.[].name' | head -10)
  ⎿  v1.3                         
     v1.2
     v1.1
     … +3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The latest version is v1.3. Let's update both workflows to use the latest version and remove
  the unnecessary connector-url parameter since it doesn't exist in the action:

● Update(~/AINativeStudio-IDE/.github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml)
  ⎿  Updated ../.github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml with 1 addition and 1 removal
       195              path: ./unsigned-artifact/ainative-studio-win32-arm64.zip

  ⎿  Updated ../.github/workflows/Windowsx64.yml with 1 addition and 1 removal 
       241              path: ./unsigned-artifact/ainative-studio-win32-x64.zip
       242          
       243          - name: Sign build artifact with SignPath
       244 -          uses: signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request@v1
       244 +          uses: signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request@v1.3
       245            with:
       246              api-token: ${{ secrets.SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN }}
       247              organization-id: 'e7b381ae-94e5-4fee-b694-0828622d0e95'

● Updated both workflows to use v1.3 (latest version) instead of v1. The connector-url parameter
  was never added - it's not a valid parameter for this action. The action connects directly to
  SignPath's API at https://app.signpath.io.

  The remaining issues are likely:
  1. SignPath project configuration - The project ainative-studio-ide with policy test-signing
  needs to exist in your SignPath account
  2. API token permissions - The token needs submitter permissions
  3. Artifact configuration - portable-executable needs to be a valid artifact configuration in
  your project

● Good progress! The SignPath action is now working correctly but encountering an authorization
  issue. The error is clear:

  "Trusted build system is not allowed to log into the organization"

  This means your SignPath organization needs to be configured to allow GitHub Actions as a
  trusted build system. You need to:

  1. Log into SignPath.io
  2. Go to your organization settings (ID: e7b381ae-94e5-4fee-b694-0828622d0e95)
  3. Enable GitHub Actions as a trusted build system
  4. Link your GitHub repository (AINative-Studio/AINativeStudio-IDE)

  The connector URL https://githubactions.connectors.signpath.io is being added automatically by
  the action (even though we didn't specify it), which is correct.

  Also note: it's still using @v1 instead of @v1.3. Let me check why:

● Bash(cd /home/darthvader/AINativeStudio-IDE && git diff HEAD~1 .github/workflows/Windowsx64.yml |
      grep -A2 -B2 "signpath")
  ⎿  +

  organization configuration - it needs to allow GitHub Actions as a trusted build system.

> did with fix the signpath org config?

● No, we haven't fixed the SignPath organization configuration. That needs to be done on
  SignPath's website, not in the code.

  What we did:
  - Fixed the GitHub Action parameters ✅
  - Updated to SignPath action v1.3 (not pushed yet)

  What you need to do on SignPath.io:
  1. Log into your SignPath account
  2. Go to organization settings for e7b381ae-94e5-4fee-b694-0828622d0e95
  3. Enable "GitHub Actions" as a trusted build system
  4. Link/authorize the AINative-Studio/AINativeStudio-IDE repository

  The error "Trusted build system is not allowed to log into the organization" is a SignPath
  configuration issue, not a code issue.

● I can see your SignPath user account has:
  - Submitter role for "AINative Studio IDE" project with "Test Signing Policy" ✅
  - API token generated ✅
  - Global administrator role ✅

  But the error says the organization isn't configured to accept GitHub Actions as a trusted
  build system. You need to:

  1. Go to the Organization Settings (not user settings)
  2. Look for "Trusted Build Systems" or "CI Integrations" section
  3. Enable GitHub Actions
  4. Add your repository: AINative-Studio/AINativeStudio-IDE

  The project slug in your workflows should match exactly:
  - Your project: AINative Studio IDE
  - In workflows we have: ainative-studio-ide

  Let me check if the slug needs to be exact:

             }}
       252              wait-for-completion: true

● Updated the signing policy slug to match your actual policy name: test-signing-policy (was
  test-signing).

  But the main issue remains: you need to configure GitHub Actions as a trusted build system in
  your SignPath organization settings.

● This is the organization overview page, but you need to find the Trusted Build Systems or CI 
  Integration settings. Look for:

  1. A Settings or Configuration section in the organization menu
  2. Trusted Build Systems or Build System Integration option
  3. GitHub Actions or GitHub configuration

  The organization page should have additional menu items or tabs. Can you check if there are
  options like:
  - "Trusted Build Systems"
  - "CI/CD Integration"
  - "Build Configuration"
  - "Security Settings"

  The error specifically says the trusted build system isn't allowed to log into your
  organization, so there must be a place to authorize GitHub Actions as a trusted build system
  for your organization.

● I see you only have these menu items:
  - Dashboard
  - Signing Requests
  - Projects
  - Certificates
  - Users

  Go to Projects and click on your AINative Studio IDE project. Inside the project settings,
  there should be options for:
  - Trusted Build Systems
  - CI Configuration
  - GitHub Integration

  The trusted build system configuration is typically found within the project settings, not at
  the organization level. Once in the project, look for a way to add GitHub Actions as a trusted
  build system.

> i added         the generated token to github already

● The API token is good, but that's not the issue. The error "Trusted build system is not allowed
   to log into the organization" means SignPath doesn't recognize GitHub Actions as an authorized
   build system.

  In your AINative Studio IDE project in SignPath, you need to:

  1. Find Trusted Build Systems section
  2. Add GitHub Actions as a trusted build system
  3. Specify your repository: AINative-Studio/AINativeStudio-IDE

  This is different from the API token - it's about authorizing GitHub Actions itself to submit
  signing requests on behalf of your repository.

  Can you share what options you see when you click into the "AINative Studio IDE" project?

● Perfect! I can see the issue now:

  1. Repository URL is configured ✅ - https://github.com/AINative-Studio/AINativeStudio-IDE
  2. Project slug is correct ✅ - ainative-studio-ide
  3. Signing policy exists ✅ - "Test Signing Policy"
  4. Artifact configuration ❌ - You have "Initial version" but workflows use portable-executable

  Let's fix the artifact configuration slug:

● Update(~/AINativeStudio-IDE/.github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml)

       202              project-slug: 'ainative-studio-ide'
       203              signing-policy-slug: 'test-signing-policy'
       204 -            artifact-configuration-slug: 'portable-executable'
       204 +            artifact-configuration-slug: 'initial-version'
       205              github-artifact-id: ${{ steps.upload-for-signing.outputs.artifact-id 
             }}
       206              wait-for-completion: true
       207              output-artifact-directory: './signed-output'

       248              project-slug: 'ainative-studio-ide'
       249              signing-policy-slug: 'test-signing-policy'
       250 -            artifact-configuration-slug: 'portable-executable'
       250 +            artifact-configuration-slug: 'initial-version'
       251              github-artifact-id: ${{ steps.upload-for-signing.outputs.artifact-id

       253              output-artifact-directory: './signed-output'

● Now, for the "Trusted build system" issue - since you have the repository URL configured, try
  looking for:
  - An "Edit" button on the signing policy
  - A "Trusted Build Systems" tab or section
  - Or check if there's a way to mark the signing policy as allowing CI/CD submissions

  The Free trial might have limitations on trusted build systems. Can you click on "Test Signing
  Policy" to see its settings?

● Found it! The issue is:

  "Require trusted build system" is ENABLED ✅ but there's no trusted build system configured for
   your project.

  You have two options:

  1. DISABLE "Require trusted build system" (easier for testing)
    - Click "Edit"
    - Uncheck "Require trusted build system"
    - Save
  2. Or configure GitHub Actions as trusted build system (more secure but complex)

  Also, I need to update the signing policy slug back to test-signing (not test-signing-policy):

● Update(~/AINativeStudio-IDE/.github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml)
  ⎿  Updated ../.github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml with 1 addition and 1 removal

       248              project-slug: 'ainative-studio-ide'
       249 -            signing-policy-slug: 'test-signing-policy'
       249 +            signing-policy-slug: 'test-signing'

       252              wait-for-completion: true

● For now, I recommend unchecking "Require trusted build system" to get it working, then you can
  set up proper GitHub Actions integration later.

> how would i fix it?

● To properly configure GitHub Actions as a trusted build system:

  1. In SignPath, while editing the Test Signing Policy:
    - Keep "Require trusted build system" checked ✅
    - Look for a "Trusted Build Systems" section or button
    - There should be an option to "Add Trusted Build System" or "Configure Build Systems"
    - Select "GitHub Actions"
    - Enter your repository: AINative-Studio/AINativeStudio-IDE
  2. If you can't find that option, it might be because:
    - Free trial accounts may not support trusted build systems
    - It might be in a different location (Project settings rather than Policy settings)
  3. Alternative: Create a new signing policy specifically for GitHub Actions:
    - Create a new policy called "GitHub CI Signing"
    - Uncheck "Require trusted build system" for this policy
    - Use this policy in your workflows

  The error message suggests SignPath expects trusted build system configuration but can't find
  it for GitHub Actions. The proper fix requires adding GitHub Actions as an authorized build
  system somewhere in the SignPath UI, but the exact location varies by SignPath version.

  For immediate testing, unchecking "Require trusted build system" will work.

● To fix it properly while keeping trusted build system verification:

  1. Uncheck "Use approval process" first (since you're using this for automated CI/CD)
    - This removes the manual approval requirement
  2. For the Trusted Build System, look for:
    - A link or button near "Require trusted build system"
    - It might say "Configure" or "Manage trusted build systems"
    - Or try looking in the main Project settings (not just the policy)

  If you can't find where to add GitHub Actions as a trusted build system, you have two working
  options:

  Option A: Disable both security features (quickest for testing)
  - Uncheck "Use approval process"
  - Uncheck "Require trusted build system"

  Option B: Keep security but allow automation
  - Uncheck "Use approval process"
  - Keep "Require trusted build system" checked
  - Create a support ticket with SignPath asking how to add GitHub Actions

  The approval process requiring manual approval is definitely incompatible with automated CI/CD,
   so that needs to be unchecked regardless.

> i do not have it checked but it has 1 inside of required approvals

● That's fine - having "1" in required approvals when "Use approval process" is unchecked means
  the approval requirement is disabled. The number is just the default value if you were to
  enable it.

  The main issue remains: "Require trusted build system" is checked but GitHub Actions isn't
  configured as a trusted build system.

  Since you can't find where to add GitHub Actions as a trusted build system in the UI, you
  should:

  1. Uncheck "Require trusted build system" for now
  2. Click Save on the policy

  This will allow GitHub Actions to submit signing requests without being registered as a trusted
   build system. You can always re-enable it later once you figure out where SignPath allows you
  to configure GitHub Actions.

  Let me know when you've saved that change and we can push our workflow fixes and test.

● Yes, I see "Trusted build system verification" with "Require trusted build system" checked. But
   where to ADD GitHub Actions as a trusted build system isn't visible on this page.

  Try this:

  1. Click on "Trusted build system verification" text itself - it might be a link
  2. Or look for an "Add" or "Configure" button near that section
  3. Check if there's a dropdown or additional options that appear when you're in Edit mode

  If none of those work, go back to the main Project page (not the policy page) and look for:
  - A "Trusted Build Systems" tab
  - A "CI/CD Integration" section
  - A "Build Systems" menu item

  The configuration to add GitHub Actions as a trusted build system has to be somewhere - it's
  just not obvious where SignPath put it in their UI.

  Worst case: uncheck "Require trusted build system" temporarily to get things working.

> SignPath
  Trusted Build Systems  ❯  GitHub
  Prerequisites
  Checks performed by SignPath
  Usage
  Define policies for source code and builds
  Prerequisites
  Use the predefined Trusted Build System GitHub.com (see configuration)
  add it to the Organization
  link it to each SignPath Project for GitHub
  Specify <zip-file> as root element of your Artifact Configurations (GitHub packages all artifacts
   as ZIP archives)
  Required for source code and build policies: Install the SignPath GitHub App and allow access to 
  the code repositories.
  GitHub Enterprise

  SignPath hosts an instance of the GitHub connector which is linked to GitHub.com For integrating 
  self-hosted GitHub Enterprise instances, contact our support team.

  Checks performed by SignPath
  The GitHub connector performs the following checks:

  A build was actually performed by a GitHub workflow, not by some other entity in possession of 
  the API token
  Origin metadata is provided by GitHub, not the build script, and can therefore not be forged
  The artifact is stored as a GitHub workflow artifact before it is submitted for signing
  For OSS projects: All jobs of the GitHub worfklow leading up to the signing request were executed
   on GitHub-hosted agents
  Usage
  We provide a submit-signing-request action that can be integrated into a GitHub Actions workflow:

  steps:
    # required for the artifact to be available on the GitHub server
  - name: upload-unsigned-artifact
    id: upload-unsigned-artifact
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:

  Total time in seconds that the action will wait for a single service call to succeed (across 
  several retries).
  download-signed-artifact-timeout-in-seconds
  300
  HTTP timeout when downloading the signed artifact.
  parameters
   
  Multiline-string of values that map to user-defined parameters in the Artifact Configuration. Use
   one line per parameter with the format <name>: "<value>" where <value> needs to be a valid JSON 
  string.
  Action output parameters
  The action supports the following output parameters:

  signing-request-id: The id of the newly created signing request
  signing-request-web-url: The url of the signing request in SignPath
  signpath-api-url: The base API url of the SignPath API
  signed-artifact-download-url: The url of the signed artifact in SignPath
  Define policies for source code and builds
  Available for Advanced Code Signing, Code Signing Gateway.
  You can define specific source code and build policies for your repository per signing policy:

  runners: define which runners may be used by GitHub Actions
  build: define conditions for GitHub Actions workflows and runs
  branch_rulesets: define minimum requirements for branch rulesets including conditions for 
  integrity, reviews, and code scanning
  Steps to create a policy file:

  create the policy file in the default branch of the source code repository
  name it .signpath/policies/<project-slug>/<signing-policy-slug>.yml
  restrict write permissions to the policy files using GitHub’s code owners feature
  Policy sections
  runners section
  Use the runners section to define which runners may be used in the workflow run.

  allowed_groups

  Provide a list of GitHub runner group names. Ensures that all jobs of the workflow are executed 
  on runners from one of the listed groups. Note that the GitHub Actions group is predefined and 
  represents GitHub-hosted runners.

  build section
  Use the build section to configure rules for the build run.

  disallow_reruns

  Set to true to prevent signing builds from re-runs. By enforcing this policy, old, temporarily 
  failed builds cannot be re-run and signed under the false impression that they include recent 
  changes, such as vulnerability fixes. These builds would still be identified by their branch 
  name, e.g. main.

  branch_rulesets section
  Use the branch_rulests section to configure conditions for GitHub branch rulesets.

  You can configure branch rulesets in GitHub on an organization or repository level. SignPath 
  verifies that there is at least one branch ruleset for each specified condition.
  Rules define minimum requirements that may be exceeded by the actual branch ruleset.
  How branch_rulesets conditions are evaluated
  You can group your policy requirements into multiple conditions, each containing a combination of
   rules, bypassers, and enforcement date:

  rules
  See below
  Rules that must be implemented by one ore more active branch rulesets
  allow_bypass_actors
  boolean
  If true, the branche ruleset is allowed to define bypassers
  enforced_from
  None, timestamp, or EARLIEST
  By default, the rules are only evaluated at the time of signing. When provided, defines that 
  these rules must have been in place from the specified date (YAML ISO timestamp) or earliest 
  availability of audit log entries (EARLIEST).
  About enforced_from evaluation

  Depending on your GitHub subscription, the continuous enforcement of policies is either based on:

  Audit log events for GitHub Enterprise subscriptions. Audit log events are only available for the
   last 180 days, any prior policy violations will not be detected.
  The last modified date of the branch rulesets for all other subscriptions. At least one branch 
  ruleset that has not been modified since the specified timestap must implement the rule.
  Available branch_rulesets rules
  restrict_creations

  Set to true to allow only users with bypass permission to create matching refs.

  restrict_updates

  Set to true to allow only users with bypass permission to update matching refs.

  restrict_deletions

  Set to true to allow only users with bypass permissions to delete matching refs.

  require_linear_history

  Set to true to prevent merge commits from being pushed to matching refs.

  require_pull_request

  Require all commits be made to a non-target branch and submitted via a pull request before they 
  can be merged. Can be set to true or defined as a block with the following parameters:

  min_required_approvals: The minimum number of required approvals.
  dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push: Set to true to dismiss stale pull request approvals when new 
  commits are pushed.
  require_code_owner_review: Set to true to require review from Code Owners.
  require_last_push_approval: Set to true to require approval of the most recent reviewable push.
  require_review_thread_resolution: Set to true to require conversation resolution before merging.
  block_force_pushes

  Set to true to prevent users with push access from force pushing to refs.

  require_code_scanning

  Configure a list of code scanning tools which must provide scan results with the following 
  entries:

  tool: The name of the code scanning tool, e.g. CodeQL
  min_alerts_threshold: one of none, errors or warnings
  min_security_alerts_threshold: one of none, critical, high, medium or all

● Perfect! Now I understand. You need to add GitHub as a trusted build system to your
  organization. Based on the documentation:

  1. Go to your Organization page (not the project page)
  2. Add the predefined "GitHub.com" trusted build system to your organization
  3. Link it to your "AINative Studio IDE" project

  The documentation says:
  "Use the predefined Trusted Build System GitHub.com... add it to the Organization... link it to
   each SignPath Project for GitHub"

  Since I can't see how to do this in your UI, look for:
  - An "Add Trusted Build System" option in your organization settings
  - Or a "Trusted Build Systems" section where you can add "GitHub.com"

  Also important: Your artifact configuration should have <zip-file> as the root element since
  GitHub packages all artifacts as ZIP archives.

  Once you've added GitHub.com as a trusted build system to your organization and linked it to
  your project, the workflows should work with "Require trusted build system" enabled.

● I don't see a "Trusted Build Systems" section on your project page. Let me help you find it:

  1. Go back to the main Dashboard (click "Dashboard" in the top menu)
  2. Look for a "Trusted Build Systems" option in the main navigation
  3. Or check if there's an "Organization Settings" or "Configuration" section

  The documentation clearly states you need to:
  - Add GitHub.com to the organization (not the project)
  - Then link it to your project

  If you still can't find it, try:
  - Click on your organization name "ainative.studio" at the top
  - Look for an "Edit" or "Settings" option for the organization itself

  The free trial might have this feature hidden or limited. As a workaround, you can:
  1. Edit your "Test Signing Policy"
  2. Uncheck "Require trusted build system"
  3. Save

  This will allow GitHub Actions to work without being registered as a trusted build system.

● I see the organization page but there's no "Trusted Build Systems" option visible. This is
  likely because:

  1. Free trial accounts may not have access to Trusted Build Systems
  2. The feature might require a paid subscription

  Immediate solution:
  1. Go back to your project → "Test Signing Policy"
  2. Click "Edit"
  3. Uncheck "Require trusted build system"
  4. Save

  This will allow GitHub Actions to submit signing requests without needing to be a registered
  trusted build system.

  Let's also commit and push our workflow fixes:

● The error persists - "Trusted build system is not allowed to log into the organization".

  Since you can't find where to add GitHub as a trusted build system and it's likely a free trial
   limitation, you need to:

  1. Go to your SignPath account
  2. Navigate to: AINative Studio IDE → Test Signing Policy
  3. Click "Edit"
  4. Uncheck ☐ "Require trusted build system"
  5. Save the policy

  This is the only way to make it work without having access to the Trusted Build Systems
  feature. The error clearly shows SignPath is rejecting GitHub Actions because it requires a
  trusted build system that isn't configured (and can't be configured on free trial).

  Once you disable that requirement, GitHub Actions will be able to submit signing requests using
   just the API token.

> trusted builkd verification is not included in free tier

● Exactly! That confirms it. Since trusted build system verification isn't available in the free
  tier, you need to:

  1. Go to SignPath → AINative Studio IDE → Test Signing Policy
  2. Click "Edit"
  3. Uncheck "Require trusted build system"
  4. Save

  This will allow GitHub Actions to submit signing requests without the trusted build system
  verification (which you can't use on free tier anyway).

  Once you make that change, the workflows should work - we've already fixed all the other
  issues:
  - ✅ Correct artifact configuration slug (initial-version)
  - ✅ Correct signing policy slug (test-signing)
  - ✅ Proper artifact upload for SignPath
  - ✅ API token configured in GitHub

  Just need to disable that one checkbox and re-run the workflow.

> i can't uncheck it, it is blurred and not clickable

● If "Require trusted build system" is grayed out and can't be unchecked, you'll need to create a
   new signing policy without that requirement:

  1. Go to your AINative Studio IDE project
  2. Create a new Signing Policy (there should be an "Add Signing Policy" button)
  3. Name it something like "GitHub CI Signing" (slug: github-ci-signing)
  4. Don't check "Require trusted build system" when creating it
  5. Select the same certificate (AINative Studio Test Certificate)
  6. Save

  Then update the workflows to use the new policy:

● Update(~/AINativeStudio-IDE/.github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml)

       249 +            signing-policy-slug: 'github-ci-signing'

       251              github-artifact-id: ${{ steps.upload-for-signing.outputs.artifact-id 
             }}
       252              wait-for-completion: true

● Create that new policy first, then we'll push these changes.

> walk me through how to create a new  policy

● Here's how to create a new signing policy in SignPath:

  1. Go to your AINative Studio IDE project page
  2. Look for an "Add" or "+" button near the "Signing Policies" section
    - It might say "Add Signing Policy" or just have a "+" icon
    - Or there might be an "Edit" button for the project that lets you add policies
  3. Fill in the new policy details:
    - Name: GitHub CI Signing
    - Slug: github-ci-signing (or it might auto-generate)
    - Description: Automated signing for GitHub Actions CI/CD
    - Certificate: Select AINative Studio Test Certificate
    - Purpose: Any (or leave default)
  4. Critical settings:
    - DO NOT check "Require trusted build system" ❌
    - DO NOT check "Use approval process" ❌
    - DO check "Verify origin" ✅ (if available)
  5. Add submitters:
    - Add yourself (Alberto Lopez)
    - Add any other users who need to submit signing requests
  6. Save the policy

  If you can't find the "Add" button, try clicking "Edit" on the project itself - there might be
  a section to manage signing policies there.

  Let me know what you see and where you get stuck!

> for slug it uses the name

● Got it! So if the slug auto-generates from the name, use one of these options:

  Option 1 (easier to type):
  - Name: GitHub CI Signing
  - Slug: will become github-ci-signing

  Option 2 (no spaces):
  - Name: github-ci
  - Slug: will become github-ci

  Then I'll update the workflows to match whichever slug gets created.

  The important parts are:
  - DO NOT check "Require trusted build system"
  - DO NOT check "Use approval process"
  - Select the same certificate: AINative Studio Test Certificate
  - Add yourself as a submitter

  Once you create it, tell me what the final slug is and I'll update the workflows.

> trusted build verification is still uncheckable even when creating new policy

● That's a problem - if you can't uncheck "Require trusted build system" even when creating a new
   policy, then the free tier forces all policies to require trusted build systems (which the
  free tier doesn't support). This is a catch-22.

  Options:

  1. Contact SignPath support - This seems like a bug where free tier forces a feature it doesn't
   support
  2. Try a different signing service that works with free tier:
    - Azure Code Signing
    - GitHub's built-in Sigstore signing
    - Self-signed certificates for testing
  3. Disable signing temporarily - Comment out the sign and package jobs in the workflows until
  you can upgrade SignPath or find an alternative
  4. Check if SignPath has a "test mode" or "development mode" that bypasses verification

  This appears to be a limitation where SignPath free tier is essentially unusable for CI/CD
  since it requires a feature it doesn't provide. Would you like me to:
  - Comment out the signing steps so builds can complete?
  - Look into alternative free signing solutions?

> i'll just have to manually sign them by uploading the .exe

● That makes sense. Let me modify the workflows to skip the SignPath signing but still create the
   unsigned installers:

● Read(~/AINativeStudio-IDE/.github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> what is an unsigned installer and what will that mean for windows?        Wouldn't it be the same
   as having no signature at all?

● Yes, you're absolutely right. An unsigned installer is the same as having no signature at all.

  What this means for Windows:
  - SmartScreen warning: "Windows protected your PC" - users must click "More info" then "Run
  anyway"
  - Security warnings: "Publisher: Unknown" when running the installer
  - Lower trust: Antivirus software may be more suspicious
  - Enterprise blocks: Many corporate environments block unsigned executables entirely

  Your current situation:
  - The builds already create unsigned .exe files and installers
  - The SignPath signing step was meant to add a digital signature
  - Since SignPath free tier is broken, you'd just skip that step

  For manual signing, you'd:
  1. Download the unsigned artifacts from GitHub Actions
  2. Sign them locally with SignPath or another tool
  3. Re-upload the signed versions to your releases

  But yes, distributing unsigned installers gives users the same warnings as if you never set up
  signing at all. The only benefit is you can manually sign important releases while automated
  builds remain unsigned.

  1. Let the GitHub Actions build the unsigned artifacts

  To make this workflow smoother, let me modify the workflows to:

> why did we change the package?

● Good question! The package job depends on the sign job (needs: sign), but since we're disabling
   the sign job, the package job would fail because it's waiting for a job that never runs.

  By changing it to needs: build-windows, the package job will run directly after the build
  completes, skipping the signing step entirely.

  However, looking closer, the package job expects to download the signed artifact. We need to
  fix that too - it should download the unsigned artifact instead. Let me check what the package
  job is doing:

● Read(~/AINativeStudio-IDE/.github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml)

● Read(~/AINativeStudio-IDE/.github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● You're right to question this! The package job is trying to download
  ainative-studio-win32-arm64-signed which won't exist since we're skipping signing. We need to
  update it to use the unsigned artifact:

● Perfect! Originally it downloaded the unsigned artifact ainative-studio-win32-arm64. We need to
   revert the package job back to using the unsigned artifact:

> was this before the new         sign changes?

● No, that was the commit that ADDED SignPath signing. Let me check the commit BEFORE that:

● Bash(cd /home/darthvader/AINativeStudio-IDE && git diff 8a2767f4~1 8a2767f4 --
      .github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml | head -100)
  ⎿ diff --git a/.github/workflows/build-windows-arm64.yml b/.github/workflows/build-windows-arm
    64.yml
    index f55b9ad6..d912705b 100644
    … +101 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

  ⎿  Shell cwd was reset to /home/darthvader/AINativeStudio-IDE/ainative-studio

● Yes! You can see that originally:
  - package depended on build-windows
  - It downloaded ainative-studio-win32-arm64 (unsigned)
  - It extracted ainative-studio-win32-arm64.zip

  When SignPath was added:
  - A new sign job was inserted between build and package
  - package was changed to depend on sign
  - It was changed to download ainative-studio-win32-arm64-signed
  - It was changed to extract ainative-studio-win32-arm64-signed.zip

  So we're reverting it back to the original unsigned workflow, which is correct!

       344              Get-ChildItem -Path . -Directory | Format-Table Name

● Done! Both Windows workflows (x64 and ARM64) have been updated to:
  1. Comment out the SignPath signing job
  2. Change package job to depend on build instead of sign
  3. Download unsigned artifacts instead of signed ones

  The workflows will now build unsigned installers that you can manually sign through SignPath's
  web interface.

> ;so this is       back to how it was before we added signing step?

● Yes, exactly! The workflows are now back to how they were before we added the SignPath signing
  step. They will:

  1. Build the application
  2. Package it directly into installers (skipping signing)
  3. Create unsigned installers

  This is the same workflow you had before adding SignPath. The only difference is the
  commented-out signing code is still there if you ever want to re-enable it later (maybe when
  you upgrade from the free tier).

  To manually sign:
  1. Download the .zip artifact from GitHub Actions
  2. Upload it to SignPath's manual signing page
  3. Download the signed version
  4. Use that for releases

  Want me to commit and push these changes?

> will i be able to upload the .exe file and sign it manually?

● Yes, you can upload the .exe file directly to SignPath for manual signing. However, there's a
  configuration issue:

  Your SignPath artifact configuration is set to "Portable Executable file (.exe, .dll, .sys, …)"
   which expects a single .exe file, but the GitHub workflows create a ZIP archive containing the
   entire application folder with many files.

  You have two options:

  1. Upload just the main .exe file (e.g., void.exe or Code.exe) from inside the ZIP
    - Download the ZIP from GitHub Actions
    - Extract it
    - Find the main executable
    - Upload just that .exe to SignPath
  2. Change your SignPath artifact configuration to accept ZIP files
    - In SignPath, edit your artifact configuration
    - Change from "Portable Executable" to "ZIP archive"
    - Then you can upload the entire ZIP file

  Which approach would you prefer? The first option signs only the main executable, while the
  second signs all executables in the package.

● Let me verify by checking the exact state before SignPath was added:

● Bash(cd /home/darthvader/AINativeStudio-IDE && git show

  ⎿  Shell cwd was reset to /home/darthvader/AINativeStudio-IDE/ainative-studio

● Yes, I'm positive! Here's the proof from before SignPath was added:

  Before SignPath (original):
  - package: needs: build-windows ✅
  - Downloads: ainative-studio-win32-arm64 ✅
  - Extracts: ainative-studio-win32-arm64.zip ✅

  Current changes (after removing SignPath):
  - package: needs: build (should be build-windows for ARM64)
  - Downloads: ainative-studio-win32-arm64 ✅
  - Extracts: ainative-studio-win32-arm64.zip ✅

  Wait, I made a small error - for ARM64 it should be needs: build-windows not needs: build. Let
  me fix that:

       240 +      needs: build-windows
       241        runs-on: windows-latest
       242        timeout-minutes: 30
       243        steps:

● Now it's exactly as it was before SignPath was added!

● Yes, you're right! You added the SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN secret to your repository. Since we're
  disabling automated SignPath signing but keeping manual signing, you can:

  1. Keep the secret - It's not hurting anything and you might want it later if you upgrade
  SignPath
  2. Remove it - Since you're doing manual signing, it's not being used

  The secret is only referenced in the commented-out signing jobs, so it won't cause any errors.

  If you want to remove it:
  1. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
  2. Click on SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN
  3. Delete it

  But I'd recommend keeping it since:
  - It's already set up
  - You might upgrade SignPath later
  - It doesn't expose any risk while unused
