> for RPM package i'm getting this error on CentOS when i attempt to install it [Image #1]

● I can see you're getting a dependency conflict when trying to install the AINative Studio RPM
  package on CentOS. The error indicates that the package requires libXtst.so.6()(64bit) but
  nothing provides the needed libXtst-file for the ainative-studio-1.0.1-x86_64 package.

● Let me search for RPM packaging configuration in the codebase to understand how dependencies
  are currently specified:

● Search(pattern: "**/*.spec")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Search(pattern: "libXtst")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Search(pattern: "rpm", glob: "**/*.json")

● Search(pattern: "linux", glob: "**/build/**/*.js")

● Perfect! I found the RPM-specific files. Let me examine the RPM dependency calculation files:

● Read(build/linux/rpm/dep-lists.js)
  ⎿  Read 317 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I can see the issue! The libXtst.so.6()(64bit) dependency is missing from all the architecture
  dependency lists in the RPM configuration. This library is needed for X11 test extensions (used
   by Electron for automation). Let me check the calculate-deps.js file to understand how
  dependencies are managed:

  field only lists nss, atk, libXkbfile, libsecret but missing libXtst.

● Fixed! I've added libXtst to the RPM package dependencies in the Linux x64 build workflow. The
  error you were seeing occurs because the RPM package requires the X11 Test extension library
  (libXtst.so.6) which is needed by Electron applications for automation features, but it wasn't
  declared as a dependency.

  The change is on line 447 of .github/workflows/linux_x64.yml - I added libXtst to the Requires:
   field in the RPM spec. Now when users install the RPM package, it will automatically install
  the required libXtst dependency and resolve the "conflicting requests" error you encountered on
   CentOS.

> are you sure this is the correct change and does it only affect the RPM file?

● You're right to question this. Let me double-check by examining the broader RPM packaging
  system and verify this is the correct approach.

● Let me check if there's a more systematic approach used elsewhere in the codebase for RPM
  dependencies:

● Bash(cd ainative-studio && find . -name "*.js" -path "*/rpm/*" -exec grep -l "libXtst\|Xtst" {} \;)

● You're absolutely right to ask! Let me check if this change affects other package formats in
  the same workflow.

● Looking at the Linux x64 workflow, I can see it creates multiple package formats:

  1. DEB package (lines 340-412) - has its own dependencies on line 407: libnss3, 
  libatk-bridge2.0-0, libxkbfile1, libsecret-1-0
  2. RPM package (lines 414-522) - this is where I made the change on line 447: nss, atk, 
  libXkbfile, libsecret, libXtst

  Yes, my change only affects the RPM package. The DEB package has separate dependency
  declarations and wasn't modified. However, I should check if the DEB package also needs the
  libXtst dependency.

  Let me check what the proper DEB package name for libXtst would be:

● Bash(apt-cache search libxtst)
  ⎿  libxext-dev - X11 miscellaneous extensions library (development headers)
     libxext-doc - X11 miscellaneous extensions library (documentation)
     libxext6 - X11 miscellaneous extension library
     … +3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The DEB package should also include libxtst6. Let me check if this is a systematic issue by
  looking at the proper dependency management system:

● Read(build/linux/dependencies-generator.js)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> .deb works fine don't touch it

● Perfect! To confirm:

  My change only affects the RPM package in the Linux x64 workflow. I added libXtst to line 447
  in the RPM spec's Requires: field. The DEB package dependencies (line 407) remain unchanged and
   will continue working as they do now.

  The fix is targeted and surgical - it only addresses the specific RPM dependency issue you
  encountered on CentOS without touching any other package formats.

> okay, let's push the change

● Bash(git status)
  ⎿  On branch main                               
     Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
     … +8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Bash(git add ../.github/workflows/linux_x64.yml)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(git commit -m "Fix RPM dependency issue: add libXtst requirement…)
  ⎿  [main 782554e1] Fix RPM dependency issue: add libXtst requirement

● Bash(git push)
  ⎿  To https://github.com/AINative-Studio/AINativeStudio-IDE.git
        3591dea1..782554e1  main -> main

● Done! The fix has been pushed to the repository. The RPM packages built from the next workflow
  run will include the libXtst dependency, which should resolve the CentOS installation error you
   encountered.
